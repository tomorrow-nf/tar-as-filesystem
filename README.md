TAR Browser

2014-15 MQP developed by Kyle Davidson and Tyler Morrow at WPI.

Released to the public domain.

The goal of the TAR Browser project is to develop a system to better extract single members from compressed TAR archives. To do so, the program must analyze a TAR archive (uncompressed or compressed with XZ or Bzip2 compression) and later use information from this analysis to extract a single desired member without decompressing much else. For many companies and users, this program can vastly improve efficiency when working with large TAR archives.
